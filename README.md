# Pewlett-Hackard Employee Database Analysis
Bob's project description
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
- Around 72k employees retiring
- Raw count was almost double, signifying that retirees fulfill multiple roles within the company which needs to be looked into carefully
- Lots of senior title retirees
- Not too many employees eligible to mentor relative to the number of employees retiring- 1550
## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
- Carefully strategy to promote and backfill in order to ensure that no information is lost in the wake of silver tsunami
- Open up the mentorship criteria to include people who have been at the company for a certain number of years as well and not just retiring employees.
