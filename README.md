# Pewlett-Hackard Employee Database Analysis
Pewlett-Hackard wants to look ahead and prepare for future retirements. Bobby is an up-and-coming data analyst who is looking to the employee database to check who are retiring and how many are retiring. Most of this data us in Excel and VBA, but Bobby is tasked with using SQL to gain this information and Bobby has asked for our help.

### Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis is to make a list of all the retiring employees and filter out all duplicates. Next, group all the employees who are retiring by their most recent titles. Then we filter current employees for people eligible to be mentors.

## Results
*The takeaways from the Retiring Employee database are as follows:*
- Around 72 thousand employees will be retiring from Pewlett-Hackard as the 'Silver Tsunami' hits
- Raw count for retiring employees was almost double when we did not filter out duplicates, signifying that retirees fulfill multiple roles within the company

- As seen from the table below, most of the retirees hold Senior titles

- Not too many employees eligible to mentor relative to the number of employees retiring (only 1500 mentors versus 72 thousand retiring)

## Summary
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Around 72 thousand employees will be retiring and all those roles need to be filled either by internal promotions or back-filling the positions. 

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

There are only about 1500 mentors to train 72 thousand employees if all of them are new employees. On the other hand if there are internal promotions, more mentors can be available as non-senior personnel can now train entry-level new employees.

- As seen from the raw retiree counts, we see that people retiring have multiple roles within the company. Thus, management needs to set up proper training flows so that there are no gaps in positions once the 'silver tsunami' begins to make impact.

- Another recommendation is to open up the mentorship criteria to include people who have been at the company for a certain number of years as well and not just retiring employees. That way there are more potential mentors available to train new employees.
